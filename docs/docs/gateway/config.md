# Gateway Server Configuration

The Vulcain Gateway Server follows [the twelve-factor app methodology](https://12factor.net/) and is configurable using [environment variables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environment_variable):

| Variable                | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

| `SUBSCRIBER_JWT_KEY`    | must contain the secret key to valid subscribers' JWT, can be omitted if `JWT_KEY` is set                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| `WRITE_TIMEOUT`         | maximum duration before timing out writes of the response, set to `0s` to disable (default), example: `2m`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

If `ACME_HOSTS` or both `CERT_FILE` and `KEY_FILE` are provided, an HTTPS server supporting HTTP/2 connection will be started.
If not, an HTTP server will be started (**not compatible with HTTP/2 Server Push, and not secure**).
