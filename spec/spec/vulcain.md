.# Abstract

This specification defines new HTTP headers (and query parameters) allowing a client to inform the
server of the exact data it needs:

 *  `Preload` informs the server that relations of the main requested resource will be necessary.
    The server can then reduce the number of round-trips by sending the related resources ahead
    of time using HTTP/2 [@!RFC7540] Server Push. When using Server Push isn't possible (resources
    served by a different authority, client or server not supporting HTTP/2...), the server can hint
    the client to fetch those resources as early as possible by using the `preload` link relation
    [@!W3C.CR-preload-20190626] and the `103` status code [@!RFC8297].

 *  `Fields` informs the server of the list of fields of the retrieved resources that will be used.
    In order to improve performance and reduce bandwidth usage, the server can omit the fields not
    requested.

# Terminology

The keywords **MUST**, **MUST NOT**, **REQUIRED**, **SHALL**, **SHALL NOT**, **SHOULD**, **SHOULD
NOT**, **RECOMMENDED**, **MAY**, and **OPTIONAL**, when they appear in this document, are to be
interpreted as described in [@!RFC2119].

# Preload Header

Many formats including HTML [@W3C.REC-html52-20171214], JSON-LD [@W3C.REC-json-ld-20140116], Atom
[@RFC4287], XML [@W3C.REC-xml-20081126], [HAL](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-kelly-json-hal-08)
and [JSON:API](https://jsonapi.org/) allow the use of Web Linking [@!RFC5988] to represent
references between resources.

The `Preload` HTTP header allows the client to ask the server to transmit resources linked to the
main resource it will need as soon as possible.

`Preload` is a List Structured Header [@!I-D.ietf-httpbis-header-structure]. Its values `MUST` be
Strings (Section 3.3.3 of [@!I-D.ietf-httpbis-header-structure]). Its ABNF is:

~~~ abnf
Preload = sf-list
sf-item = sf-string
~~~

Its values are selectors (#selectors) matching links to resources that `SHOULD` be preloaded. If a
value is an empty String, then all links of the current documents are matched.

The server `MUST` recursively follow links matched by the selector. When a selector traverses
several resources, all the traversed resources `SHOULD` be sent to the client. If several links
referencing the same resource are selected, this resource `MUST` be sent at most once.

The server `MAY` limit the number resources that it sends in response to one request.

Example:

~~~ http
Preload: "/member/*/author", "/member/*/comments"
~~~

The following optional parameters are defined:

 *  A Parameter whose name is `rel`, and whose value is a String (Section 3.3.3
    of [@!I-D.ietf-httpbis-header-structure]) or a Token (Section 3.3.4 of
    [@!I-D.ietf-httpbis-header-structure]), conveying the expected relation type of the selected
    links.

 *  A Parameter whose name is `hreflang`, and whose value is a String (Section 3.3.3 of
    [@!I-D.ietf-httpbis-header-structure]), conveying the expected language of the selected links.

 *  A Parameter whose name is `type`, and whose value is a String (Section 3.3.3 of
    [@!I-D.ietf-httpbis-header-structure]), conveying the expected media type of the selected links.

The `rel` parameter contains a relation type as defined in [@!RFC5988]. If this parameter is
provided, the server `SHOULD` preload only relations matched by the provided selector and having
this type.

The `hreflang` parameter contains a language as defined in [@!RFC5988]. If this parameter is
provided, the server `SHOULD` preload only relations matched by the provided selector and in this
language. When possible (for instance, when doing a HTTP/2 Server Push), the server `SHOULD` set
the `Accept-Language` request header to this value. If the `hreflang` parameter isn't provided but
the server is able to guess the expected language of the relation using other mechanisms (such as
the `hreflang` attribute defined by the Atom format for the `atom:link` element, [@RFC4287] Section
4.2.7.4), then the `Accept-Language` request header `SHOULD` be set to the guessed value.

The `type` parameter contains a media type as defined in [@!RFC5988]. If this parameter is provided,
the server `SHOULD` preload only relations matched by the provided selector and having this media
type. When possible (for instance, when doing a HTTP/2 Server Push), the server `SHOULD` set the
`Accept` request header to this value. If the `type` parameter isn't provided but the server is
able to guess the expected media type of the relation using other mechanisms (such as the `type`
attribute defined by the Atom format for the `atom:link` element, [@RFC4287] Section 4.2.7.3), then
the `Accept` request header `SHOULD` be set to the guessed value.

If several parameters are provided for the same selector, the server `SHOULD` preload only relations
matching the selector and constraints hinted by the parameters.

Examples:

~~~ http
Preload: "/member/*/author"; hreflang="fr-FR"
Preload: "/member/*/author/avatar"; type="image/webp"
~~~

The server `SHOULD` preload all links matched by the `/member/*/author` selector and having a lang
of `fr-FR`, as well as all links matching the `/member/*/author/avatar` selector and having a type
of `image/webp`.

~~~ http
Preload: ""; rel=author
Preload: ""; rel="https://example.com/custom-rel"
~~~

The server `SHOULD` preload all links of the requested resource having the relation type `author` or
`https://example.com/custom-rel`.

## Preload Example

Considering the following resources:

`/books`

~~~ json
{
    "member": [
        "/books/1",
        "/books/2"
    ]
}
~~~

`/books/1`

~~~ json
{
    "title": "1984",
    "author": "/authors/1"
}
~~~

`/books/2`

~~~ json
{
    "title": "Homage to Catalonia",
    "author": "/authors/1"
}
~~~

`/authors/1`

~~~ json
{
    "givenName": "George",
    "familyName": "Orwell"
}
~~~

The `Preload` HTTP header can be used to ask the server to immediately push resources related to the
requested one:

~~~ http
GET /books/ HTTP/2
Preload: "/member/*/author"
~~~

In addition to `/books`, the server `SHOULD` use HTTP/2 Server Push to push the `/books/1`,
`/books/2` and `/authors/1` resources. While it is referenced twice, `/authors/1` `MUST` be pushed
only once.

Server Push requests generated by the server for related resources `MUST` include the remaining
selector in a `Preload` HTTP header. When requesting a pushed relation, the client `MUST` compute
the remaining selector and pass it in the `Preload` header.

Explicit Request:

~~~ http
GET /books/ HTTP/2
Preload: "/member/*/author"
~~~

Request to a relation generated by the server (for the push) and the client:

~~~ http
GET /books/1 HTTP/2
Preload: "/author"
~~~

## Using Preload Link Relations

Sometimes, it's not possible or beneficial to use HTTP/2 Server Push: reference to a resource not
served by the same authority, client or server not supporting HTTP/2, client having disabled Server
Push, resource probably already stored in the cache of the client... To hint the client to preload
the resources by initiating and early request, the server `CAN` add references to the resources to
preload using `preload` link relations [@!W3C.CR-preload-20190626].

# Fields Header

The `Fields` HTTP header allows the client to ask the server to return only the specified fields of
the requested resource, and of the preloaded related resources.

The `Fields` HTTP header is a List Structured Header accepting the exact same values than the
`Preload` HTTP header defined in (#preload-header).

The `Fields` HTTP header `MUST` contain a selector (see #Selector). The server `SHOULD` return only
the fields matching this selector.

All matched fields `MUST` be returned if they exist. Other fields of the resource `MAY` be omitted.

## Fields Example

Considering the following resources:

`/books/1`

~~~ json
{
    "title": "1984",
    "genre": "novel",
    "author": "/authors/1"
}
~~~

`/authors/1`

~~~ json
{
    "givenName": "George",
    "familyName": "Orwell"
}
~~~

And the following HTTP request:

~~~ http
GET /books/1 HTTP/2
Preload: "/author"
Fields: "/author/familyName", "/genre"
~~~

The server must return a response containing the following JSON document:

~~~ json
{
    "genre": "novel",
    "author": "/authors/1"
}
~~~

And push the following filtered `/authors/1` resource:

~~~ json
{
    "familyName": "Orwell"
}
~~~

Server Push requests generated by the server for related resources `MUST` include the remaining
selector in a `Fields` HTTP header. When requesting a pushed relation, the client `MUST` compute the
remaining selector and pass it in the `Fields` header.

Example:

Explicit Request:

~~~ http
GET /books/ HTTP/2
Fields: "/member/*/author"
~~~

Request to a relation generated by the server (for the push) and the client:

~~~ http
GET /books/1 HTTP/2
Fields: "/author"
~~~

# Selectors

Selectors used as value of the `Preload` and `Fields` HTTP headers depend on the `Content-Type`
of the requested resource. This specification defines default selector formats for common
content-types, and a mechanism to use other selector formats.

The client `SHOULD` use the `Accept` HTTP header to request the resource in a format compatible with
selectors used in `Preload` and `Fields` HTTP headers.

The client can use the `Prefer` HTTP header [@!RFC7240] with the `selector` preference to ask the
server to use a specific selector format:

~~~ http
GET /books/1 HTTP/2
Accept: text/xml
Prefer: selector=css
Fields: "brand > name"
~~~

If no explicit preferences have been passed, the server `MUST` assume that the selector format is
the default corresponding to the format of the resource.

The following table defines the default selector format for common formats:

Format  | Selector format                                | Identifier
--------|------------------------------------------------|----------------
JSON    | Extended JSON Pointer (#extended-json-pointer) | `json-pointer`
XML     | XPath [@!W3C.REC-xpath-19991116]               | `xpath`
HTML    | CSS selectors [@!W3C.REC-selectors-3-20181106] | `css`

The client and the server can negotiate the use of other selector formats using the `Prefer` HTTP
header.

## Extended JSON Pointer

For JSON documents, the default selector format is JSON Pointer [@!RFC6901]. However, JSON Pointer
doesn't provide a mechanism to select entire collections.

This specification defines an extension to the JSON Pointer format allowing to select every element
of a collection, the `*` character.

Considering the following JSON document:

~~~ json
{
    "books": [
        {
            "title": "1984",
            "author": "George Orwell"
        },
        {
            "title": "The Handmaid's Tale",
            "author": "Margaret Atwood"
        }
    ]
}
~~~

The `/books/*/author` JSON Pointer selects the `author` field of every objects in the `books` array.

The `*` character is escaped by encoding it as the `~2` character sequence.

By design, this selector is simple and limited. Simple selectors make it easier to limit the
complexity of requests executed by the server.

# Query Parameters

Another option available to clients is to utilize Request URI query-string parameters to pass
preload and fields selectors.

The `preload` and `query` parameters `MAY` be used to pass selectors corresponding respectively to
the `Preload` and `Fields` HTTP headers. Valid values for these query parameters are exactly the
same than the ones defined of the `Preload` and `Fields` HTTP headers.

In conformance with the Section 3.4 of the URI RFC [@!RFC3986], values of query parameters `MUST` be
percent-encoded.

For instance, the list of fields selector `"/title","/author"` and the preload
selector `"/author"` passed using query parameters will result in the following URL:
`/books/1?fields=%22%2Ftitle%22%2C%22%2Fauthor%22&preload=%22%2Fauthor%22`.

When using query parameters, the server `MUST` pass the remaining part of the selector as parameter
of the generated link.

`Preload` and `Fields` HTTP headers aren't [CORS safe-listed
request-headers](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#cors-safelisted-request-header). Query parameters,
on the other hand, allow to send cross-site requests that don't trigger preflight requests. Also,
query parameters don't require clients to compute the remaining part of the selector when requesting
relations.

However, support for query parameters can be challenging to implement by servers (links contained in
served documents `MUST` be modified) and generate URLs that are hard to read for a human.

Altering the URI can also have undesirable effects.

For these reasons, using HTTP headers `SHOULD` be preferred. Support for query parameters is
`OPTIONAL`. A server supporting query parameters `MUST` also support the corresponding HTTP headers.

Example:

~~~ http
GET /books/?preload=%22%2Fmember%2F%2A%2Fauthor%22 HTTP/2

{
    "member": {
        "/books/1?preload=%22%2Fauthor%22",
        "/books/1?preload=%22%2Fauthor%22"
    }
}
~~~

Example using parameters:

~~~ http
GET /books/?preload=%22%2Fmember%2F%2A%22%3B%20rel%3Dauthor HTTP/2

{
    "member": {
        "/books/1?preload=%22%22%3B%20rel%3Dauthor",
        "/books/1?preload=%22%22%3B%20rel%3Dauthor"
    }
}
~~~

# Computing Links Server-Side

While using hypermedia capabilities of the HTTP protocol through Web Linking `SHOULD` always be
preferred, sometimes links between resources are known by the server but are not provided in the
HTTP response.

In such cases, the server can compute the link server-side in order to push the
related resource. Such server-side computed links `MAY` be documented, for instance
by providing an [OpenAPI specification](https://www.openapis.org/) containing [Link
objects](http://spec.openapis.org/oas/v3.0.2#link-object).

Considering the following resources and assuming that the server knows that the `author` field
references the resources `/authors/{id}` resource:

`/books/1`

~~~ json
{
    "title": "1984",
    "author": 1
}
~~~

`/authors/1`

~~~ json
{
    "givenName": "George",
    "familyName": "Orwell"
}
~~~

In response to this request , both `/books/1` and `/authors/1` should be pushed:

~~~ http
GET /books/1 HTTP/2
Preload: "/author"
~~~

# Security Considerations

Using the `Preload` header can lead to a large number of resources to be generated and pushed. The
server `SHOULD` limit the maximum number of resources to push. The depth of the selector `SHOULD`
also be limited by the server.

# IANA considerations

The `Preload`and `Fields` header fields will be added to the "Permanent Message Header Field Names"
registry defined in [@!RFC3864].

A selector registry could also be added.

# Implementation Status

[RFC Editor Note: Please remove this entire section prior to publication as an RFC.]

This section records the status of known implementations of the protocol defined by this
specification at the time of posting of this Internet-Draft, and is based on a proposal described
in [@RFC6982]. The description of implementations in this section is intended to assist the IETF in
its decision processes in progressing drafts to RFCs. Please note that the listing of any individual
implementation here does not imply endorsement by the IETF. Furthermore, no effort has been spent to
verify the information presented here that was supplied by IETF contributors. This is not intended
as, and must not be construed to be, a catalog of available implementations or their features.
Readers are advised to note that other implementations may exist. According to RFC 6982, "this will
allow reviewers and working groups to assign due consideration to documents that have the benefit
of running code, which may serve as evidence of valuable experimentation and feedback that have
