Vulcain is a brand new protocol using HTTP/2 Server Push to create fast and idiomatic **client-driven REST** APIs.

An open source gateway server which you can put on top of **any existing web API** to instantly turn it into a Vulcain-compatible one is also provided!

It supports [hypermedia APIs](https://restfulapi.net/hateoas/) but also any "legacy" API by documenting its relations [using OpenAPI](docs/gateway/openapi.md).

The protocol has been published as [an Internet Draft](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-dunglas-vulcain/) that [is maintained in this repository](spec/vulcain.md).

A reference, production-grade, implementation [**gateway server**](docs/gateway/install.md) is also available in this repository.
It's free software (AGPL) written in Go. A Docker image is provided.

## Introduction

Over the years, several formats have been created to fix performance bottlenecks impacting web APIs: [over fetching, under fetching](https://stackoverflow.com/a/44568365/1352334), [the n+1 problem](https://restfulapi.net/rest-api-n-1-problem/)...

[Current solutions for these problems (GraphQL, JSON:API's embedded resources and sparse fieldsets, ...)](docs/graphql.md) are smart [network hacks](https://apisyouwonthate.com/blog/lets-stop-building-apis-around-a-network-hack) for HTTP/1. But these hacks come with (too) many drawbacks when it comes to HTTP cache, logs and even security.

Fortunately, thanks to the new features introduced in HTTP/2, it's now possible to create true REST APIs fixing these problems with ease and class! Here comes Vulcain!

See also [the comparison between Vulcain and GraphQL and other API formats](docs/graphql.md).

## Pushing Relations

![Preload Schema](schemas/preload-header.png)

Considering the following resources:

`/books`

```json
{
    "member": [
        "/books/1",
        "/books/2"
    ]
}
```

`/books/1`

```json
{
    "title": "1984",
    "author": "/authors/1"
}
```

`/books/2`

```json
{
    "title": "Homage to Catalonia",
    "author": "/authors/1"
}
```

`/authors/1`

```json
{
    "givenName": "George",
    "familyName": "Orwell"
}
```

The `Preload` HTTP header introduced by Vulcain can be used to ask the server to immediately push resources related to the requested one using HTTP/2 Server Push:

```http
GET /books/ HTTP/2
Preload: "/member/*/author"
```

In addition to `/books`, a Vulcain server will use HTTP/2 Server Push to push the `/books/1`, `/books/2` and `/authors/1` resources!

Example in JavaScript:

```javascript
const bookResp = await fetch("/books/1", { headers: { Preload: `"/author"` } });
const bookJSON = await bookResp.json();

// Returns immediately, the resource has been pushed and is already in the push cache
const authorResp = await fetch(bookJSON.author);
// ...
```

[Full example, including collections](fixtures/static/main.js), see also [use GraphQL as query language for Vulcain](docs/graphql.md#using-graphql-as-query-language-for-vulcain).

Thanks to [HTTP/2 multiplexing](https://stackoverflow.com/a/36519379/1352334), pushed responses will be sent in parallel.

When the client will follow the links and issue a new HTTP request (for instance using `fetch()`), the corresponding response will already be in cache, and will be used instantly!

For non-hypermedia APIs (when the identifier of the related resource is a simple string or int), [use an OpenAPI specification to configure links between resources](docs/gateway/openapi.md).
Tip: the easiest way to create a hypermedia API is to use [the API Platform framework](https://api-platform.com) (by the same author as Vulcain).

[More than 90% of users](https://caniuse.com/#feat=http2) have devices supporting HTTP/2. However, for the remaining 10%, and for cases where using HTTP/2 Server Push isn't allowed such as when resources are [served by different authorities](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7540#section-10.1), Vulcain allows to gracefully fallback to [`preload` links](https://www.w3.org/TR/preload/), which can be used together with [the 103 status code](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8297).

### Query Parameter

Alternatively to HTTP headers, the `preload` query parameter can be used:

![Preload Query Schema](schemas/preload-query.png)

## Filtering Resources

![Fields Schema](schemas/fields-header.png)

The `Fields` HTTP header allows the client to ask the server to return only the specified fields of the requested resource, and of the preloaded related resources.

Multiple `Fields` HTTP headers can be passed. All fields matching at least one of these headers will be returned. Other fields of the resource  will be omitted.

Considering the following resources:

`/books/1`

```json
{
    "title": "1984",
    "genre": "novel",
    "author": "/authors/1"
}
```

`/authors/1`

```json
{
    "givenName": "George",
    "familyName": "Orwell"
}
```

And the following HTTP request:

```http
GET /books/1 HTTP/2
Preload: "/author"
Fields: "/author/familyName", "/genre"
```

A Vulcain server will return a response containing the following JSON document:

```json
{
    "genre": "novel",
    "author": "/authors/1"
}
```

It will also push the following filtered `/authors/1` resource:

```json
{
    "familyName": "Orwell"
}
```

### Query Parameter

Alternatively to HTTP headers, the `fields` query parameter can be used to filter resources:
